> **Project:** Realistic Synthetic ‚Äî AI Financial Market Data for Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Llama (Meta)

---

## üîé Project Overview

This repository contains a complete data analysis project that explores a synthetic daily financial dataset (2015-01-01 to 2024-12-31) for companies that developed prominent AI products: **OpenAI (GPT)**, **Google (Gemini)**, and **Meta (Llama)**. The goal is to extract actionable financial and event-driven insights that would be useful for finance professionals, quant analysts, and data-driven product/strategy teams.

Key business problems addressed:

* How much did companies spend on R&D across time, and how did that relate to revenue?
* How did product launches and major events affect stock impact (daily index changes)?
* Which events caused the highest market response?
* What is the trajectory of AI revenue growth per company?
* How do financial metrics correlate (R&D vs Revenue vs Stock Impact)?

## üßæ Dataset Summary

* **Coverage:** 2015-01-01 to 2024-12-31 (daily granularity)
* **Companies:** OpenAI, Google, Meta
* **Core variables (sample):**

  * `date` ‚Äî day
  * `company` ‚Äî OpenAI / Google / Meta
  * `r_and_d_spend` ‚Äî daily R&D expense (synthetic)
  * `revenue` ‚Äî daily revenue (synthetic)
  * `stock_index` ‚Äî synthetic index or stock price proxy
  * `stock_impact` ‚Äî derived measure: daily percent change vs previous close
  * `event` ‚Äî text label if a product/event happened that day (launch, update, earnings, etc.)

> Note: dataset is synthetic but realistic; documented assumptions and event annotations are included in `/data/README_data_dictionary.md`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
* Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and narrative
* Matplotlib / Plotly for visualizations (static and interactive)
* seaborn for quick EDA
* Git & GitHub for version control and presentation

### 1) R&D Spending ‚Äî Cumulative & Yearly

* Aggregate R&D spend per company (yearly totals, CAGR).
* Visuals: stacked area chart (2015‚Äì2024) + bar chart showing year-by-year spend.
* Recruiter take-away: show how you convert daily noise into strategic yearly insights and calculate meaningful KPIs (CAGR, % of revenue spent on R&D).

### 2) Revenue Earned by Companies

* Yearly revenue totals and YoY growth rates for each company.
* Visuals: grouped bar charts, growth rate lines, waterfall for year-to-year changes.

### 3) Date-wise Impact on the Stock

* Compute daily `stock_impact = (stock_index - stock_index.shift(1)) / stock_index.shift(1)`.
* Plot time-series with event markers (launches, earnings, major press).
* Highlight abnormal returns using z-score or rolling volatility.

### 4) Events when Maximum Stock Impact was Observed

* Rank events by absolute stock impact across companies.
* Provide event-level case studies (e.g., product launch ‚Äî pre vs post 30-day returns).
* Visuals: top 10 event cards with mini time-series and impact metric.

### 5) AI Revenue Growth of the Companies

* Decompose revenue into AI-related (if annotated) vs non-AI (if available).
* Fit simple growth models and compute projected AI revenue share.

### 6) Correlation between Key Columns

* Correlation matrix (Pearson + Spearman for robustness).
* Pairplots for relationships: R&D vs Revenue, R&D vs Stock Impact, Revenue vs Stock Impact.
* Discuss multicollinearity implications for regression.

### 7) Expenditure vs Revenue Year-by-Year

* Scatter + regression lines per year and by company.
* KPI: R&D-to-Revenue ratio and its trend.

### 8) Event Impact Analysis

* Event study window analysis ([-30, +30] trading days) computing cumulative abnormal returns (CAR).
* Hypothesis testing (t-test or bootstrap) to see whether event windows produced statistically significant returns.

### 9) Change in Index w.r.t Year & Company

* Annualized volatility, average returns, max drawdown per year and company.
* Heatmap for quick visual comparison.

## ‚úÖ Reproducibility & How to Run

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-financial-market-analysis
```

2. Create environment and install packages

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebooks in order (01 ‚Üí 04) or execute `src/data_pipeline.py` to regenerate processed datasets.

## üéØ Top Insights (example highlights to include in portfolio)

* **R&D intensity:** Company A spent an average of X% of revenue on R&D (2019‚Äì2024), and increases in R&D spend preceded revenue accelerations by ~12 months.
* **Event sensitivity:** Product launches produced median 5-day CAR of +Y% (statistically significant at p < 0.05) for the launching company.
* **Correlation:** R&D and revenue show a moderate positive correlation (Pearson r ‚âà 0.46), while R&D and same-day stock impact are weakly correlated.
* **Top-impact events:** A ranked list of the top 10 events (with short descriptions) showing market reactions.
